It contains a research of the demographics in Poland, the population will be separated in two groups:

## :ballot_box_with_check: A.	By level of income: Low vs High

### [:white_check_mark: Jupyer notebook - R](https://github.com/lajobu/Data-analysis/blob/master/1%20Polish%20demography/High%20Low%20income/High%20Low%20income%20R.ipynb)
### [:white_check_mark: Jupyer notebook - Python](https://github.com/lajobu/Data-analysis/blob/master/1%20Polish%20demography/High%20Low%20income/High%20Low%20income%20Python.ipynb)

## :ballot_box_with_check: B.	By area of living: Rural vs Urban

### [:white_check_mark: Jupyer notebook - R](https://github.com/lajobu/Data-analysis/blob/master/1%20Polish%20demography/Rural%20Urban%20areas/Rural%20-%20Urban%20R.ipynb)

The `manipulation of the data was made with R`, and the `graphs were created with Python`. Personally, for the purpose of creating graphs, I prefer to use Python with the package matplotlib, because in my opinion the graphs are fancier than in R, with the package ggplot2.
