# Data analysis

* This repository contains several data analysis projects. You will be able to find code written in R and Python.
# 1. Polish demography:

* It contains a research of the demographics in Poland, the population will be separated in two groups:

## A.	By level of income: Low vs High

## B.	By area of living: Rural vs Urban

* The manipulation of the data was made with R, and the graphs were created with Python. Personally, for the purpose of creating graphs, I prefer to use Python with the package matplotlib, because in my opinion the graphs are fancier than in R, with the package ggplot2.

* Example of graph created in this analysis:
